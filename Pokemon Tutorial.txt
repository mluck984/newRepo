Pokemon Entry Tutorial

There are 6 classes you will need: Pokemon.as, PokemonHolder.as, Move.as, and MoveHolder.as, Type.as, and Ability.as.

Step 1 – Copy and Paste
1.	Copy the last Pokemon entry in the PokemonHolder class, beginning from case statement to the break statement.
2.	Paste it below, leaving a space between the entry you just pasted and the last entry.

Step 2 – Base Attributes
1.	Replace “case Pokemon.NAME” with “case Pokemon.” and then the name of your Pokemon, all caps.
2.	Go to http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page and search for your Pokemon.
3.	Fill in all of the relative information for your Pokemon.
4.	Height is in meters, weight is in kg.
6.	Enter the typing of your Pokemon.  If a Pokemon has only one type, enter “Type.NONE” for the secondary type.
7.	Enter the base stats and EV yield.  They go in the order [hp, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed].
8.	For genderRatio, the number is the percentage of your Pokemon that is male in decimal form.
9.	For xpRate, look in the Pokemon class for the XP constants and the comments that say which are which.

Step 3 – Evolutions
1.	Check to see if your Pokemon evolves at all.  If not, use these two lines:

	pokemon.evolveLevel = 0;
	pokemon.evolveTypes.push(Pokemon.EVOLUTION_NONE);

2.	If your Pokemon evolves by level, set evolveLevel to that level and push the appropriate evolution constant.
3.	If your Pokemon evolves by item or stone, also include the line:

	pokemon.evolveItems.push(Item.FIRE_STONE);

	where “FIRE_STONE” is the item your Pokemon must be holding or exposed to.
4.	For all other cases, use the appropriate evolution constant.
5.	If a Pokemon evolves into multiple Pokemon, then you will need to repeat the code for each evolution.

Step 4 – Moves
1.	Find the list of your Pokemon's moves.  Begin with the moves they learn via level up.
2.	For each move, use the line:

	pokemon.movepool.push(MoveHolder.getMove(4, Move.TAIL_WHIP));

	where the first parameter of MoveHolder.getMove() is the level they learn the move, and the second parameter
	is the constant of the move that is being learned.
3.	If the move is learned at "Start", instead of a level, write Move.LEARN_START for MoveHolder.getMove()'s
	first parameter.
4.	If the move's constant doesn't exist in the Move class:
		1. Open Move.as and find the list of move constants.
		2. Go to the end of the list, hit enter twice, and add the line:

		public static const YOUR_MOVE_CONSTANT:int = 0;

		where "YOUR_MOVE_CONSTANT" is the name of your move in all caps and underscores for spaces.
		Keep the int set to 0.  Eventually, you'll compile a separate list of move constants that will all
		be worked back into the actual class.
5.	Do this for each level-up move.
6.	Repeat for all moves a Pokemon learns via TM, using the line:

	pokemon.movepool.push(MoveHolder.getMove(Move.LEARN_TM, Move.TAIL_WHIP));

7.	If your Pokemon is the first of its evolutions, repeat for all moves learned via breeding with this line:

	pokemon.movepool.push(MoveHolder.getMove(Move.LEARN_EGG, Move.TAIL_WHIP));

	You don't have to do this for Pokemon that have evolved.
